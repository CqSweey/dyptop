Instructions to run DYPTOP demonstration program.

1. To compile the Fortran90 code, enter the following in the terminal and make sure the present working directory is where the Makefile and all source files are located:
      
      make

   This creates an executable called 'dyptop'. Fortran compilation is done using either gfortran of pgf95. Compiler is selected in Makefile.

2. To execute the the DYPTOP demonstration program, enter the following in the same directory:

      ./dyptop

Output printed to screen should be equal to what is given in file ‘screenout.txt’. Use this as a check.

That's it. Have fun with DYPTOP!
